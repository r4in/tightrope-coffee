              If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them.
              We never use notifications for marketing. If you will upload files

              We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep
              you logged in. Our server software may also store basic technical
              information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.

              Tightrope Coffee’s app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics,
              such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to
              improve the app. No personal data is used to target Tightrope
              Coffee’s ads. Each ad collects, and shares with its advertiser,
              only three numbers: total views, total taps, and total
              subscriptions from the ad.

              hashed, not stored, using industry-standard methods (currently
              bcrypt).
